    <h2>Miami</h2>

    <p> Travel to this South Florida city to experience a melting pot of cultures. The vibrant food and nightlife scenes are worth the trip alone, so grab a frita (a Cuban-style hamburger) in Little Havana before dancing the night away in one of the city's countless clubs. If you're not a fan of clubbing, don't fret: Miami offers a variety of museums filled with exhibits about the city's unique art, history and culture; some visitor favorites include the Pérez Art Museum Miami and The Bass. Plus, the city sits close to the famous sands of Miami Beach.</p>

    <h2>Chicago</h2>

    <p> The Windy City's architecture, cuisine and museums make this Midwestern locale an excellent option for travelers with varying interests. Be sure to stuff your face at least once, whether it be with a Chicago-style hot dog (sans ketchup), an Italian beef sandwich or a slice of deep-dish pizza. Then, snap some pictures in front of Millennium Park's iconic "Bean" sculpture, check out the Art Institute of Chicago's top-notch collections or go on an architecture river cruise. If you plan on visiting in winter, pack your warmest attire and head to Maggie Daley Park to go ice skating</p>

The city boasts a variety of activities, ranging from hiking in Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve – which sits just north of the city – to surfing at Mission and Pacific beaches.

    <img src="NewYork.jpg" alt="New York Statue of Liberty">
    <p> Known for its diverse cultural scene, the Big Apple boasts so many things to do that it puts most of its U.S. peers to shame. Whether you choose to spend the day perusing The Metropolitan Museum of Art's exhibits, catching a show on Broadway or trying the city's famous pizza, chances are you'll never find yourself feeling bored here. When you need some respite from the city's busy street life and soaring skyscrapers, retreat to scenic Central Park or the artsy High Line</p>

    <h2>Honolulu</h2>
    <img src="Honolulu.jpg" alt="Honolulu City with Volcano">
    <p> Oahu features a nice balance of urban and beach environments. And with pleasant weather year-round, there really is no wrong time to visit this Hawaiian paradise. Waikiki Beach promises to please, but be forewarned: There's a good chance a barrage of tourists will greet you. For extra elbow room, head to more secluded options like Waimanalo Bay Beach Park and Kalama Park. Before leaving, carve out some time for visiting Honolulu naval sights like the Pearl Harbor National Memorial and the Battleship Missouri Memorial.</p>

<div id="div6">
    <h2>Yosemite</h2>
    <img src="Yosemite.jpg" alt="Yosemite Mountains">
    <p>A vacation at Yosemite National Park in California is all about reconnecting with nature. Spend your visit checking out famous landmarks like Half Dome and Glacier Point or hiking Cathedral Lakes, the Mist Trail and other popular paths. You'll also want to save time to admire Yosemite's numerous waterfalls, including towering Yosemite Falls, which is one of the tallest waterfalls in the world. If you're not one for camping, opt for a daytrip from San Francisco, Sacramento or Lake Tahoe.</p>
